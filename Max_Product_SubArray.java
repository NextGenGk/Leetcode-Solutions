// Output -
/*
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
*/

// Algorithm -
/*
1. Initialize maxProduct to Integer.Min_Value & product to 1
2. Loop through left to right
3. Find product And adding on max product (which of the two is bigger (maxProduct or product));
4. Check if product is 0, then initialize product is 0
5. Loop through right to left
6. Find product And adding on max product (which of the two is bigger (maxProduct or product));
7. Check if product is 0, then initialize product is 0
8. Finally return maxProduct
